While it is easy to create a blinking LED with the delay() function, 
and many sketches use short delays for such tasks as switch debouncing, 
the use of delay() in a sketch has significant drawbacks. No other reading 
of sensors, mathematical calculations, or pin manipulation can go on 
during the delay function, so in effect, it brings most other activity to a halt. 
For alternative approaches to controlling timing see the Blink Without Delay sketch, 
which loops, polling the millis() function until enough time has elapsed. More 
knowledgeable programmers usually avoid the use of delay() for timing of events longer 
than 10â€™s of milliseconds unless the Arduino sketch is very simple.
