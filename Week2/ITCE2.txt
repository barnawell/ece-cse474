1.1) value of *ptr is 10
1.2) value of x is 20
1.3) 'ptr = 20' causes an error because we are assigning an interger value 
     directly to the pointer variable 'ptr'.

2.1) value of *chPtr is 'A'
2.2) value of ch is 'B'
2.3) 'chPtr = 'C'' causes an error because, again, we are assigning a character directly
     to the pointer variable, which is illegal.

3.1) value of *ptrNum is 1
3.2) value of *(ptrNum + 2) is 3
3.3) the value of *ptrNum would go through the array, starting at 1, and increasing to the
     end of the array with every print statement made where we incremented the pointer.

4.1) value of *p is 5
4.2) value of **q is 5
4.3) by changing the value of y, we subsequently change the values of *p and **q
